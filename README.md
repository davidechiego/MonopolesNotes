# MonopolesNotes
Some seminar notes on Magnetic Monopoles

On these notes I based my talk in the student-led
seminar "Topics in Quantum Field Theory", which took place during the last Winter Semester 2024/25 at LMU Munich. 
My presentation focused on the quantum-mechanical and field-theoretical formal implications of Magnetic Monopoles.

The seminar was organised and supervised by Prof. Dr. Gerhard Buchalla, to whom I am grateful for this very nice opportunity.
